# Hi there 👋 I'm Daniel

## About me  
🔍 I’m a developer from Lublin (Poland) with a strong focus on Python backend (Django, FastAPI) and practical open-source tools. I like building things that solve real problems and keep code clean, simple and maintainable.

## What I build  
- 🧰 **flake8-ado** - A Flake8 plugin that checks code comments for Azure DevOps ticket references.  
- 📦 **django-auth-microservice** - A Django-based microservice for identification, authentication and authorization.  
- 🔄 From time to time I contribute to other open-source projects when something catches my attention.

## My tech stack  
- **Languages**: Python (main), JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Shell  
- **Frameworks & tools**: FastAPI, Django, Flake8 plugins, microservices  
- **Practices**: CI/CD, code linting, smart automation, developer-friendly workflows

## Fun facts  
- 🚀 I prefer lightweight, elegant solutions instead of unnecessary complexity.  
- 📘 I treat code as craft — clarity and maintainability matter.  
- 🌱 I’m always learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques.

## What I'm looking for  
I’m open to:  
- Building or collaborating on open-source tools  
- Backend and microservice-oriented work  
- Environments that care about quality, automation and thoughtful engineering
